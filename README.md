# NCAA Football Team Performance and Revenue

## Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between college football performance and athletic department revenue across Division I public universities. College football is a significant revenue generator, driven by ticket sales, television contracts, sponsorships, and fan attendance. However, the extent to which on-field success translates to financial performance is not always clear.

Our analysis focuses on three key questions:

1. Is there a correlation between a teamâ€™s win-loss record and total revenue?
2. Does higher average attendance at home games lead to increased revenue?
3. Do teams that qualify for bowl games generate significantly higher revenue?
To answer these questions, we combined performance data (wins, losses, attendance, and bowl participation) with financial data (total revenue and expenses) for Division I public teams from 2005 to 2023.
